## Accounts.js Upload

You can upload and import one or many accounts.js files. Their contents can be merged into your existing accounts or replace it entirely.

Select the file you wish to upload and the interface will tell you how many accounts it located.

You will then be returned to the Accounts Manager to review and save the imported accounts.

You can also paste in file contents instead of using the file uploader by using the manual upload mode.
