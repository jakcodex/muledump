## Backup Upload

If you want to restore a previously downloaded backup then you can upload it using this tool.

Backups include a copy of all your accounts, options, and settings. 

You can upload the backup by either choosing the file using the browser or pasting it in manual mode.

Once you provide the file it will inform you how many items are being restored. Click outside the text area in manual mode to trigger the information update.
