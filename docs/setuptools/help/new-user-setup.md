## New User Setup

#### No Errors

If there were no errors then you should be all set! You should download a backup of your configuration in case you ever need to restore.

You can manage backups in the [Backup Manager](/docs/setuptools/help/backup-manager.md).

#### Oops, there was a problem.

If no valid accounts were detected then this error will be displayed. Account emails and IDs must be valid in order to be saved.

If you are positive your username is correct, then consider opening an issue on the Github page to report the bug.
