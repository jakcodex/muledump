# Jakcodex / Muledump

## Welcome

This is a fork of Atomizer's [Muledump](https://github.com/atomizer).

## Synopsis

This tool allows you to list contents of all your accounts in a single page (characters, their stats and items, items in vaults). Also it generates a summary of all the items - you probably saw screenshots of these in trading forum ([example](https://imgur.com/dDA2vC9)).

The point of playing the game is to have fun. Muling is not fun. I am trying to increase overall fun ratio by decreasing amount of time spent fussing with mules and storagekeeping.

## Requirements

Currently due to how Deca handles requests to ROTMG servers a browser extension is required to use this Muledump.

See the [Requirements](REQUIREMENTS.md) page for more information.

### Head over to [Installation and Setup](https://github.com/jakcodex/muledump/wiki/Installation-and-Setup) in the wiki for a detailed setup guide.
