# SetupTools Help

Welcome to SetupTools! Take a moment to read the [Overview](/docs/setuptools) if you are new here.

There are three ways you can get started.

### New Users
If you have never used Muledump before or don't have an existing accounts.js file to import, then simply follow this menu option to the line-by-line account manager tool.

You can add one or many accounts with ease.

### Returning Users
Have a backup stored in your browser or on your computer? You can quickly restore the backup to get Muledump running in seconds.

### Accounts.js Migration
Whether you have an existing accounts.js file in your Muledump folder or files stored on your computer you'd like to upload, you can import as many accounts.js files you need to into this system.
